# purple-fluxer

A **libpurple / Pidgin** protocol plugin for [Fluxer](https://fluxer.app) —
a free, open-source, self-hostable Discord-compatible instant messaging platform.

> **Alpha software.** The plugin is functional for day-to-day text messaging
> but lacks file attachments, MFA, and voice. Expect rough edges.

## Changelog

### v0.2.0

- **CAPTCHA challenge flow** — first login from a new client opens Fluxer in
  the browser and prompts for the session token; token is saved for all future
  logins. Duplicate dialogs on autorecon retry are suppressed.
- **Auto re-login on session expiry** — WS close codes 4004 and 4006 trigger
  a clean re-authentication instead of a hard disconnect.
- **DM history on login** — last 50 messages loaded automatically when a DM
  window is opened after connecting.
- **Inline image / GIF rendering** — image attachments are rendered as
  clickable links with an `<img>` tag when the URL ends in a known image
  extension.
- **Mention resolution** — `<@user_id>` and `<#channel_id>` tokens in
  incoming messages are resolved to display names. Messages containing your
  own username or `@everyone` set `PURPLE_MESSAGE_NICK` for tab highlighting.
- **Outgoing markdown** — messages typed in Pidgin's HTML input are converted
  to Discord markdown dialect before sending (bold, italic, strikethrough,
  inline code, code blocks, spoilers).
- **System/bot account handling** — accounts with `"bot": true` are placed in
  a dedicated "Fluxer System" buddy group and outbound messages to them are
  blocked with an error dialog.
- **Own discriminator display** — connection display name shows
  `username#discriminator` when the account has a non-trivial discriminator.
- **Stability fixes** — fixed crash on `chat_id_map` free (GINT_TO_POINTER
  values), fixed assertion on `SESSIONS_REPLACE` (array `d` field), fixed
  crash when disconnect races signal registration, suppressed libpurple
  `free(0x1)` on reconnect.

## Build

### Dependencies

```
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install libpurple-dev libjson-glib-dev libglib2.0-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install libpurple-devel json-glib-devel glib2-devel

# Arch
sudo pacman -S libpurple json-glib glib2
```

### Compile and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beadon/purple-fluxer.git
cd purple-fluxer
make

# Install plugin for current user only (no sudo needed):
make install-user

# Or system-wide:
sudo make install
```

### Protocol icon (optional — silences log warnings)

Pidgin 2.x looks for protocol icons in the system pixmaps directory only;
there is no user-local path. A placeholder icon can be installed with:

```bash
make install-icons   # generates a PNG and installs it with sudo
```

---

## Setup in Pidgin

1. Restart Pidgin after installing the plugin.
2. **Accounts → Manage Accounts → Add**
3. Protocol: **Fluxer**
4. Username: your Fluxer **email address**
5. Password: your Fluxer password

### First-time login (CAPTCHA challenge flow)

The Fluxer server requires CAPTCHA verification the first time you log in with
email and password from a new client. The plugin handles this automatically:

1. Enter your email and password and connect as normal.
2. The plugin detects the CAPTCHA requirement, **opens fluxer.app in your
   browser**, and shows a dialog in Pidgin.
3. Log in to Fluxer in the browser window.
4. Open **Developer Tools** (`F12`) → **Application** → **Local Storage** →
   `https://fluxer.app` and copy the value of the `token` key.
5. Paste the token into the Pidgin dialog and click **Connect**.

The token is saved automatically — subsequent connections are fully automatic
with no browser step.

### Token login (skip the dialog — power users / bots)

1. Open the **Advanced** tab when adding/editing the account.
2. Paste your token into the **Token** field.
3. Leave Username/Password blank (or fill them — token takes priority).

### Self-hosted instance

In the **Advanced** tab, change **API base URL** to your instance, e.g.:

```
https://api.myfluxer.example.com/v1
```

The gateway connects directly to `gateway.fluxer.app` (or the equivalent on
your self-hosted server).

## Usage notes

### Channel history

When you open a guild channel, the last 50 messages are loaded automatically.
To page further back, type `/more` in the channel. Each invocation loads the
next 50 messages before the current oldest. Because libpurple has no
insert-at-position API, history pages are appended below live messages with
a labelled date-range separator.

### Channels in the buddy list

Channels are grouped as **"Guild / Category"** in the Pidgin buddy list.
This is a workaround for libpurple 2.x supporting only one level of nesting
(the proper fix requires upstream Pidgin changes).

---

## Known limitations / upstream Pidgin work items

These require changes to libpurple/Pidgin itself — tracked as future
contribution targets:

1. **Nested buddy list groups** — libpurple only supports one level of
   grouping; guild → category → channel needs two.
2. **Scroll-to-top history trigger** — no plugin hook for "user scrolled to
   top"; workaround is the `/more` command.
3. **Insert message at timestamp** — `serv_got_chat_in` always appends to
   the bottom; history pages appear below live messages rather than above.
4. **Protocol UI hints** — no API for a plugin to suggest default window
   behaviours (e.g. hide the participant list by default for large guilds).
5. **Blist entry bolding for unread closed channels** — the plugin stores
   unread state in blist node data (`unseen-count`) and shows a notice when
   the user opens an unread channel. However, Pidgin only bolds buddy list
   entries for chats that have an open `PurpleConversation`. There is no
   public API to bold a closed chat entry without opening a window. Full
   support requires a new "unseen chat" signal or node-data hook in
   libpurple's `gtkblist.c`.
6. **Typing indicators in guild chat rooms** — `serv_got_typing` and
   `send_typing` are IM-only APIs; there is no equivalent for `PurpleConvChat`.
   Typing notifications in guild channels are silently dropped. The proposed
   API would be `serv_got_chat_typing(gc, chat_id, username, state)` mirroring
   `serv_got_chat_in`, and a corresponding `chat_send_typing` prpl op alongside
   the existing `send_typing`.
7. **Per-guild display names (server nicknames)** — Discord-compatible platforms
   support a per-server nickname distinct from the global username. libpurple
   buddies have a single global alias; `get_cb_alias` has no room/guild context
   parameter, so per-guild overrides cannot be implemented at the plugin level.
8. **Pending-send delivery indicator** — The web client greys out an outgoing
   message until the server acknowledges it, then renders it normally. libpurple
   has no `PURPLE_MESSAGE_PENDING` flag and no API to update the visual state of
   an already-displayed message. Messages appear immediately as sent with no
   delivery feedback.

## Architecture

Fluxer's API is intentionally Discord-compatible. Key surface used:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/auth/login` | Email+password → bearer token |
| `POST /v1/users/@me/channels` | Open DM with a user |
| `POST /v1/channels/{id}/messages` | Send a message |
| `POST /v1/channels/{id}/typing` | Send typing indicator |
| `GET /v1/channels/{id}/messages` | Fetch message history |
| `wss://gateway.fluxer.app/?v=1&encoding=json` | Real-time event gateway |

Gateway opcodes match Discord's (HELLO=10, IDENTIFY=2, DISPATCH=0, etc.).
The plugin implements a full RFC 6455 WebSocket frame parser and masker
since libpurple 2.x has no native WebSocket support.

### Connection flow

```
fluxer_login()
  └─ stored token → fluxer_use_token()
  └─ else POST /auth/login → fluxer_got_login_response() → fluxer_use_token()
       └─ fluxer_ws_connect()  [SSL + WebSocket upgrade]
            └─ HELLO (op:10) → send heartbeat + IDENTIFY (op:2)
                 └─ READY dispatch → seed buddy list, request guild members
                      └─ GUILD_MEMBERS_CHUNK → populate chat room participant lists
```

### Key gateway events handled

| Event | Handler |
|---|---|
| `READY` | Seed user/guild/DM maps, start buddy list population |
| `GUILD_CREATE` | Build channel/category hierarchy, request member list |
| `GUILD_MEMBERS_CHUNK` | Populate chat room participant lists |
| `CHANNEL_CREATE` | Register new channel in maps |
| `MESSAGE_CREATE` | Route to DM or guild chat |
| `MESSAGE_UPDATE` | Show edit notice + re-post new content |
| `MESSAGE_DELETE` | Show deletion notice with attribution |
| `TYPING_START` | Stub (needs user_id→name lookup) |
| `PRESENCE_UPDATE` | Map Fluxer status to libpurple status |

## Contributing

PRs welcome. The most impactful near-term improvements:

- **Markdown rendering** — convert Discord markdown dialect (bold, italic,
  strikethrough, inline code, code blocks, spoilers) to Pidgin HTML before
  passing to `serv_got_chat_in` / `serv_got_im`. Reference: `discord-markdown.c`
  in purple-discord.
- **Mention resolution + `@mention` tab highlight** — `MESSAGE_CREATE` embeds
  raw IDs: `<@user_id>`, `<#channel_id>`, `@everyone`. Replace with display
  names using the existing `user_names` and `channel_names` maps. When the
  resolved name matches `fd->self_username` (or the message contains
  `@everyone`), add `PURPLE_MESSAGE_NICK` to the flags passed to
  `serv_got_chat_in` — Pidgin will then highlight the tab in a distinct colour
  rather than just bolding it.
- **Blist bolding for unread channels** — `read_states` parsing and
  `unseen-count` node data are implemented; a notice appears when the user
  opens an unread channel. Full blist bolding (before opening) requires
  upstream Pidgin work — see Known Limitations item 5.
- **File attachments** — render attachment URLs as clickable links; for images,
  optionally show inline using libpurple's image API.
- MFA (TOTP) login flow
- `TYPING_START` → `serv_got_typing()` (needs user_id→username index, already collected)
- Buddy avatar download and caching
- `GUILD_MEMBER_ADD` / `GUILD_MEMBER_REMOVE` events (live member list updates)
- Message reply context (quote preview above the reply body)

See the "Known limitations" section above for upstream Pidgin contribution
opportunities.
